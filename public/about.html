<h1>About Me</h1>
<p><H4>Hi there!</H4> <br/>I'm an aspiring web developer, just starting my exciting journey into the world of code. I've recently begun learning HTML, the foundation of web development, and I'm eager to see what I can build.</p>

<p>While I'm still early in my learning process, I'm proud to say I've already completed two small projects using HTML. I'm excited to keep learning, expanding my skills, and tackling more complex projects in the future.</p>

<p>If you're interested in web development or just starting out yourself, feel free to reach out and connect! I'm always open to learning and collaborating with others on this shared adventure.</p>
